        {/* <p>Hi there, welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Manoj Gadamchetty, and I'm passionate about all things tech. My journey in the world of computer science has been quite the adventure—a mix of problem-solving, creativity, and a whole lot of learning.</p> */}
        <h1 className="title">About Me</h1>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Manoj, and I'm passionate about crafting digital solutions that make a mark online.My journey into the tech realm kicked off when I started creating simple games with Unity. What began as a dive into game development unexpectedly became a treasure trove of learning experiences. Crafting interactive worlds and gaming elements using Unity back in 2018 turned out to be a rich classroom, teaching me far more than I ever anticipated!</p>
        
        <p>Since then, I've had the privilege of diving into diverse tech environments—from a software firm to academia and research, each adding a unique brushstroke to my tech canvas. These days, my focus revolves around building inclusive, user-friendly applications and digital experiences. I work on a range of projects for varied clients, ensuring accessibility and inclusivity take center stage.</p>
        
        <p> Some of the technologies I've been immersed in lately include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Kotlin</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Matlab</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Beyond the code and the tech, I'm all about connecting with the possibilities tech brings and exploring ways to make a meaningful impact online. Thanks for stopping by—let's explore the ever-evolving digital landscape together!</p>
